As part of my goal to actually have a professional web presence (which starts with this blog), I made a home page.

[http://tyrsius.com/](http://tyrsius.com/)

Look at the URL. It's beautiful.

It's nothing special to look at right now, but I plan on spiffing it up in the next week or two. Right now it's just some links to me various communities. Not sure if I should put a bio section in or not.

Next up will be my updated portfolio site. It's about 2 years old now, so it's a bit overdue.
