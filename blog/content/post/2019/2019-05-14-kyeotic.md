This last weekend I went through what I thought would be the laborious process of changing my handle from "Tyrisus" to "[Kyeotic](https://kyeotic.com/kyeosis)" on every site I use. This turned out to be breeze.

With the exception of [Reddit](https://reddit.com) I was able to change the name on my account everywhere. Reddit does not allow this, and I ended up creating an entirely new account. 

Most sites, like [Discord](https://discordapp.com) make it a button press. Some sites, like GitHub, offer an automated migration process. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) was a bit of a standout with an awkward, manual, email-driven process where I created a new account and they migrated the content and *some* of my history over.

In all, I spent about 6 hours moving accounts. I spent a lot longer [migrating this blog](/migrating-ghost-0-x-to-2-x).
