Have you ever wanted to just check out someone's [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) unit test's without having to set up an environment? Or maybe you wanted a quick and easy space to write and run some of your own tests.

Well, I've made something just for you: [jsTestLite](http://tyrsius.github.io/jsTestLite/). It's jsFiddle for Jasmine unit tests. Write your code, write your tests, and watch them run as you type (with a short [debounce](http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/)) in the results section. The code boxes are [Ace Editors](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about), and your tests are saved to local storage as they are run. You can even save multiple tests, and switch between them. All of this from some static HTML and Javascript!

As usual my code is on Github, you can check out the [source here](https://github.com/tyrsius/jsTestLite). Feedback is welcome as always.
